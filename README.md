# Beer-Me
Make beer recipes with friends and post on eachothers created beers!

## Usage
As stated before, the usage of this app is to create a community that creates beer recipes and allows users to post on each recipe their thoughts.

Beer-Me is a web application that uses Rails. A user is able to sign up by providing a username, email, and password. They can also sign-in via their google account. Once they sign up they will be logged in and brought their User page. This pages shows them all of the individual beers they posted on, as well as all of their posts. Users will notice links at the top of the page that provides them the ability to logout, see their user page, see all of the beers made, add a beer, and view all of the beers over 5%.

To edit or delete a beer recipe, the user just needs to click on either edit or delete button under the beer. If they choose edit, it will bring them to where they can update the beer, but if they choose delete, the beer will be deleted and the user will be redirected to the beers index (aka All Beers). A user can edit or delete their post on a beer by going to their user page and clicking on the exact post they wish to edit/delete. This would bring them to the exact post of that exact beer and they can click on either edit or delete. 

To logout the user just needs to click on the logout button on the top right of the screen.


## Installation

## Roadmap
Eventually I can see myself adding to this app that allows other users to see which User posted which post. I may also add more to the stylesheet as it is very bland at the moment.
